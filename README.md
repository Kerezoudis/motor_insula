This is the custom-made MATLAB code associated with the manuscript:

"The Human Insula Encodes Somatotopic Representation of Motor Execution with an Effector-Specific 
Connectomic Map to Primary Motor Cortex."

The data can be found in the following link: https://osf.io/bmdy6/.

The code is written in MATLAB language (Mathworks, 2022a). 
It only requires installation of the Signal Processing Toolbox. 
All other functions and dependencies are provided in this repository 
and can be run on any MATLAB version. 

In order to reproduce the analyses from the manuscript, set the directory to the dataset folder. 
Open the file “ins_mot_master.m”, enter the three-letter patient code in the first cell (e.g. pt = ‘ROR') 
and run each section. Each step of analysis is shown clearly in the functions called from this file. 

The figures generated can be used to recreate all figures of the paper. 
We have annotated the code in a manner that clearly explains its purpose. '

Please note that we use a “code-section” approach to programming (each section headed by “%%”), 
and it is intended that you evaluate each section (control-enter or command-enter) in sequence to understand each step.
